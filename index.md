## About Me

Hi! I am a Master's student in the Computer Science department at UC Santa Barbara. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from UC Davis. I have both technical software internship and research experience, and am interested in research involving human-based data as well as research that allows machines to saliently and semantically process their environments, such as via multimodal input. **Broadly, I am interested in machine learning for medicine, language and computer vision (and, by extension, psychology/neuroscience), and hardware-adjacent applications like robotics.**

## Past Experience

- **[Sept 2021 - June 2024]** Research assistant in the Janata Lab at UC Davis 
    - Used PyTorch to build and train a CNN on 200 music-evoked memory passages for prediction of lifetime periods; used other natural language libraries to analyze/visualize sentiments, similarities, and various patterns across memories. 
    - Used Django and an AWS-hosted SQL database to set up models and pipelines for running and storing analyses. 
    - Led project and taught other undergraduate students to get set up with coding environments and database.
- **[Summers 2023 and 2024]** Software engineering intern at General Motors 
    - Wrote an in-house Python data logging library + GUI to send with all 30+ vehicle electrical control units (ECUs) via DoIP and CAN protocol; allowed users to send requests to any module and decode various diagnostic responses. 
    - Wrote scripts for real time testing (RTT) scenarios for vehicle simulation and maneuvers; created a plotting tool to visualize relevant signals when verifying bench functionality tests.
- **[June 2022 - June 2023]** Biochem data science/research with Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) 
    - Wrote Python scripts and used PyTorch to train, tune, and visualize graph-based machine learning models on 2D SMILES data, including SARS-CoV-2 data, for unsupervised/semi-supervised learning and supervised property prediction. Utilized LLNLâ€™s high performance computing (HPC) clusters to deploy SLURM batch jobs. 
    - Informally presented results comparing results of training based on proportions of unsupervised and supervised training data used.

## Other Work

I play and compose music sometimes! You can check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@birdbard" target="_blank">music youtube channel</a>.

- **[March 2025]**: I did the music & audio for an alternative controller video game, Sashimi Slayer, which is exhibiting at alt.ctrl.GDC in San Francisco this March 19-21! Learn more about the game and our team <a href="https://linktr.ee/shrimpfriedricegames" target="_blank">here</a>!
