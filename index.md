## About Me

Hi! I am a Master's student in the Computer Science department at UC Santa Barbara. 

My Bachelor's degree is in Computer Science and Engineering from UC Davis. I have both technical software internship and research experience, and am interested in research that allows machines to saliently and semantically process their environments via multimodal inputs and human-based data. **Broadly, I am interested in machine learning for medicine, computer vision (and, by extension, psychology/neuroscience), and hardware adjacent applications like robotics.**

## Past Experience

- **[Sept 2021 - June 2024]** Research assistant in the Janata Lab at UC Davis 
    - Used PyTorch to build and train a CNN on 200 music-evoked memory passages for prediction of lifetime periods; used other natural language libraries to analyze/visualize sentiments, similarities, and various patterns across memories. 
    - Used Django and an AWS-hosted SQL database to set up models and pipelines for running and storing analyses. 
    - Led project and taught other undergraduate students to get set up with coding environments and database
- **[Summers 2023 and 2024]** Software engineering intern at General Motors 
    - Wrote an in-house Python data logging library + GUI to send with all 30+ vehicle electrical control units (ECUs) via DoIP and CAN protocol; allowed users to send requests to any module and decode various diagnostic responses. 
    - Wrote scripts for real time testing (RTT) scenarios for vehicle simulation and maneuvers; created a plotting tool to visualize relevant signals when verifying bench functionality tests 
- **[June 2022 - June 2023]** Biochem-related data science research with Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL). 
    - Wrote Python scripts and used PyTorch to train, tune, and visualize graph-based machine learning models on 2D SMILES data, including SARS-CoV-2 data, for unsupervised/semi-supervised learning and supervised property prediction. Utilized LLNL â€™s high performance computing (HPC) clusters to deploy SLURM batch jobs. 
    - Informally presented results comparing results of training based on proportions of unsupervised and supervised training data used.
